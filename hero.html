<img src="images/Albert.jpg"400"/>

<p> Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14, 1879. His father was an engineer and owned and operated an electrical business in Munich, Germany. Einstein's mother was a pianist and taught him how to play at a young age. In 1894, Einstein's parents moved to Milan, Italy to open a new business. Einstein struggled in grade school and had a speech impediment. His teachers would harass and pick on him. After a year in Munich alone, Einstein was kicked out of school. Albert decided he had no more love for the German people and left Munich shortly after getting kicked from school. 

<p> Doubted as a child, Einstein would prove the world wrong and become the father of modern physics. Albert Einstein's accomplishments changed the world through his research in modern science, the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, and standing up for his own religion and its people. Einstein would become a United States citizen in 1940. The great scientist remained in New Jersey until the rest of his life.Albert Einstein's work and research led to new inventions and hopefully an increasingly nicer, more respectful earth. Albert Einstein taught the world that a quiet, inaudible kid that gets bad grades can grow up to be the smartest to ever live.  Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
